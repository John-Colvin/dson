This is a D JSON library to be used as an alternative for the standard library
JSON parser. This library offers the following promises.

* Parsing and writing speeds are comparable with the standard library.
* The library can be included by copying and pasting the file, no frameworks.
* Garbage creation is minimised, so 'stop the world' effect will be lessened.
* Working with JSON types should almost as easy as working with D primitives.

The source contains generated documentation with a few helpful examples.
